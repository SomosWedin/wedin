# CLAUDE.md (prisma)

`schema.prisma` stays comment-free. Non-obvious context about fields,
indexes, and migration gotchas lives here instead — update this file
whenever you touch something documented below.

## Mongo/Prisma gotchas

- **Sparse unique indexes**: any `String? @unique` field needs its
  underlying index manually converted to `sparse: true`. Prisma's schema DSL
  has no `sparse` option, and `prisma db push` will not create or repair it —
  a non-sparse unique index tolerates only **one** document missing the
  field; the second write throws `P2002`. Existing examples: `User.email`,
  `Image.giftId`, `Event.url`. Fix via raw Mongo commands whenever a new
  optional `@unique` field is added:
  ```
  db.<Collection>.dropIndex("<Field>_key")
  db.<Collection>.createIndex({ <field>: 1 }, { unique: true, sparse: true, name: "<Field>_key" })
  ```
- **`prisma db push` never touches existing documents** — it only updates
  the schema definition. Two ways this bites:
  - Renaming/narrowing an enum's values leaves old documents holding the old
    string; Prisma throws `Value 'X' not found in enum 'Y'` the moment it
    reads that field — and a `try/catch`-wrapped read (the convention
    elsewhere in this codebase) silently swallows that into an empty
    result, not a visible error. Backfill existing documents in the same
    pass (raw `$runCommandRaw` `update`, mapping old values to new) — see
    the `Transaction.paymentMethod`/`PaymentMethod` migration for the
    pattern.
  - Adding a new required field with a `@default(...)` does not backfill
    that default onto existing documents — only new writes get it. See
    `WishlistGift.quantity`/`reservedQuantity` below: before deploying a
    change like that to an environment, run a one-time raw Mongo backfill
    against that environment's database (not checked into this repo — kept
    as a local, one-off script per environment, run by hand). `Category`
    is the sharpest case so far: between `db push` and the backfill, _any_
    Prisma read of a `Category` throws on documents missing `sortOrder`, so
    the backfill has to go through `$runCommandRaw` — it cannot bootstrap
    itself via `prismaClient.category.findMany`.

## Field notes

- `WishlistGift.isReceived` — repurposed as an "archived" flag.
  `deleteWishlistGift` sets it instead of hard-deleting when the gift has
  any Transaction (any status) still pointing at it. Archived gifts are
  excluded from the guest site and the organizer's default `/wishlist` view,
  but the row and its transactions are kept. Despite the name, it's not
  literally "physically received" — no dedicated concept for that exists
  yet.
- `WishlistGift.reservedAmount` / `reservedQuantity` — atomic overselling
  guards used by `actions/data/checkout.ts` (group gifts held by amount,
  individual gifts held by unit count). Not `@unique`; atomicity comes from
  Mongo's single-document write, not an index.
- `WishlistGift.quantity` — total units available for an individual gift;
  unused for group gifts. Default `1` preserves pre-quantity-feature
  behavior for existing gifts.
- `Transaction.quantity` — always `1` for group-gift contributions; can be
  > 1 for an individual-gift purchase.
- `Category.eventTypes` — which `EventType`s a category is offered for;
  drives `getCategories(eventType)` and the catalog scoping in `getGifts` /
  `getGiftlists`. A list rather than a scalar because `Category.name` is
  `@unique`: with a scalar, a category offered for both event types would
  need two rows sharing a name, which the index rejects. The two taxonomies
  are disjoint today, so nothing sets both — the exception is a legacy row
  mid-migration, parked on `['WEDDING', 'OTHER']` so it stays visible until
  its gifts are retagged.
- `Category.sortOrder` — the catalog list has a deliberate order ("Luna de
  miel" first), so `getCategories` sorts on this before falling back to
  `name`. The canonical categories occupy 1..9 (see `prisma/seed.ts`); give
  any legacy row a higher number so it sorts last.
- `Transaction.bankTransferGroupId` — shared by every transaction created
  from the same `BANK_TRANSFER` cart checkout. The equivalent of
  `pagoparHash` for `CARD` transactions, since bank transfer never gets a
  Pagopar-issued hash to group by.
